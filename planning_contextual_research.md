# Planning Contextual Research
## Research Focus
What do users struggle with when searching for and adding items to a grocery cart using Longos Grocery Gateway?  
  
  
_Note: May be replaced with Walmart Online, PC Express, or another similar service. Longos Grocery Gateway is only available in regions serviced by Longos, which may restrict potential participants. However, the UX Researcher is most familiar with Longos Grocery Gateway._

## Context
Longos Grocery Gateway has (bad) responsive design and the experience differs depending on screen size/resolution. Categorize data received via interview/observation as either "mobile" or "desktop".
Focus on the end-to-end shopping context of:
* Search for an item
* Add an item to cart
* Review cart
* Schedule delivery
* Specify and process payment
* Receive order confirmation

## Participants
Participants will largely be drawn from friends, family, colleagues, and cohort members. Use targeted email and/or Slack DM communication with instructions for the shopping task and a link to a pre-prepared survey. Once survey results are received, follow up via email or Slack and schedule a 1:1 interview to be conducted via Zoom/Meet. Consider providing $10 Longos gift card to 1:1 participants as incentive to complete the task. Participants will be more likely to pay and schedule delivery if incentive is provided.  
 
Participants must include:
* Desktop user
* Mobile user
* Young/tech-savvy user
* Old/tech-novice user  

Participants must:
* Be 18-75
* Are able to purchase things online on their own
* Are interested in or have already signed up for Longos Grocery Gateway

## Research Plan
* Methods - Interviews, in-context observation (mobile and desktop), surveys.
* Reach out to participants informally via email or Slack before sending instructions and survey link. Advise 30 minutes to account for time on the Longos Grocery Gateway site and to complete the survey. Friends and family will want to help but do not assume all reached out to will participate. Aim for 50%. Goal is for users to complete the specified shopping tasks, complete an order on Longos Grocery Gateway, and then fill out a survey targeted to understand and improve the UX.
* Following receipt of survey, reach out and thank participant and set up (optional) scheduled Zoom or Google Meet session. Users will complete the same tasks again while being directly observed. Completing order is optional (consider incentive to encourage order completion). Include connection and screen-sharing instructions in the invitation.
* Observe the following tasks, in this order:
  * Search for an item
  * Add an item to cart
  * Review cart
  * Schedule delivery
  * Specify and process payment
  * Receive order confirmation
